# FRs-for-other-Apple-3rd-party-devs

a repository for my UI/UX quirks, bug and issue fixes in third arty software I use from Apple macOS to iWork apps to FCP X to Adobe (too many) to indie developers.

figured I may as well start share this info as some of these bugs in Apple iPadOS, iPhoneOS and macOS are many years old and I still haven't see fixes for thse issues.

# IU-UX-thrills-n-spills

a repository for my log of UI/UX quirks, bug and issue fixes in third arty software I use from Apple macOS to iWork apps to FCP X to Adobe (too many) to indie developers.

figured I may as well start share this info as some of these bugs in Apple iPadOS, iPhoneOS and macOS are many years old and I still haven't see fixes for thse issues.  

often these issues/bugs/FR have been lodged with the developer in question (eg. Apple) and occasionally on third party trackers like Radar but having them here allows broader discussion of the issues, bugs and FR on forums, YT video comments etc etc
